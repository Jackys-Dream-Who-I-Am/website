						<p>The creation of WHO I AM is intended to be your Safe Space, 
							an isle where you can be 100% your true authentic self - no walls needed. Our purpose is to empower you in all shades of your uniqueness, so that you have the strength and longevity to follow yours. And so, together we make the world a better place.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>It all began in 2020 when I first tipped my toes into body and mindset work. As I worked as a leader in Business Development and Sales for many years, 
							I mainly utilized Yoga and Meditation practice for my own health and sanity. One of the key takeaways of the first month into the regular practice was, that it is more than just physical activity.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Curious to deepen my own Yoga practice, I joined a 200h Yoga Teacher Training program. 
							Although I did not know is yet back then, it was the kickoff into my very own FLOW. Through teaching Yoga, I experienced the warmth and contentment that overcame me when working with individuals. Further Trainings and Coachings followed until I created my own Vision.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Today I am grateful to offer you my companionship as a certified Coach.</p>
						<p></p>
						<strong>
						<p class="row justify-content-center">GREAT LEADERSHIP ISN'T ABOUT POWER - IT IS ABOUT EMPOWERING</p> 
						</strong>
						<p></p>
						<p>I am not a therapist, not a consultant, not a doctor - I am your Coach!</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>Throughout my career and leadership I have worked myself up to an inch-length away from burnout several times. 
							Unaware about Coaching I drew on my last resources to dig into hours and hours of self reflection, reading books and some therapy sessions. 
							Still I had to make a cut and restart to finally find release. On the way out, I began to analyze causes and individual reasons internally and externally, to unpack my formula of prevention.</p>
						<p></p>
						<p>As a Certified Systemic Coach and fully certified Breathwork Instructor all I aim for is to help you detect imbalance, find the right path for you and sustainably prevent from severe burnout.</p>
